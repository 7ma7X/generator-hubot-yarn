# generator-hubot-yarn

**Yarn-friendly** Yeoman generator for Hubot framework.  
Although [hubotio/generator-hubot](https://github.com/hubotio/generator-hubot) is widely used as `generator-hubot`, it depends on `npm install` internally.  
If you prefer to use Yarn in your hubot program, maybe this module is a good alternative. :thumbsup:

## Installation

You must install `yo` & `coffeescript` in advance.

```sh
# yarn global add yo
# yarn global add coffeescript
yarn global add generator-hubot-yarn
```

## Usage

`yo hubot-yarn`

## Getting Started

See [Hubot's Getting Started
guide](https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/README.md) for
details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.
`generator-hubot-yarn` is a replacement for `hubot --create`,
so you skip that step if you've done `yo hubot-yarn` already.
